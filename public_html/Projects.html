                    <p>This my first website.<br />
                        Its a very basic website that was made with just HTML 5 and CSS.<br />
                        This was my first website I ever made.

                    <p>This is my second website.<br />
                    It is a more advanced website that was made with the same technology as the first... <br />
                    ... But with the addition of Bootstrap, which made making this website so much easier to create. <br />
                    It is  also responsive so it will look the same across all platforms. <br />
                    I am very proud of WHOLE website, I feel that I am starting to reach my full potential.
