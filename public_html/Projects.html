              <p>This my first website.<br />
                 Its a very basic website that was made with just HTML 5 and CSS.<br />
                 This was my first website I ever made.

              <p>This is my second website.<br />
                 It is a more advanced website that was made with the same technology as the first... <br />
                 ... But with the addition of Bootstrap, which made making this website so much easier to create. <br />
                 I am very proud of this website, I felt that I am starting to reach my full potential.
